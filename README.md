# Shooty Game

Super simple VR shooting game done as a learning experience with BabylonJS

## Vite Setup
https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project

npm init vite@latest
cd project-name
npm install
npm run dev

In package.json change the default build action to include the base path so when the Action runs the build files will know they are going to be in a sub folder.

"build": "vite build --base=/repo-name/"

## Add Babylon

npm install --save babylonjs babylonjs-gui babylonjs-loaders

then in main.js

import * as BABYLON from 'babylonjs';
import 'babylon-js-gui';
import 'babylonjs-loaders';

## Workflow

Add .github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml

Note that Vite builds to a dist folder so make sure its using the output of folder: dist
